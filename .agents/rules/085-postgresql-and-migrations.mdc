# PostgreSQL and Migration Standards

- Use PostgreSQL as canonical relational backend.
- Keep migration workflow deterministic and reversible.
- Never edit applied migrations in-place; create follow-up migrations.
- Validate schema changes with integration tests and representative data.
- For Hemma operations, use explicit database target and command context.
